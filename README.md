## Adaptive method to measure sensory thresholds

## Usage
- Use the simulation script 'AdaptiveTest_UserSimulation.py' to adjust the experiment parameters 
- Run the experiment script 'LinesLengthJNDThreshold.py' to take a test based on the adaptive procedure implemented. In this test your ability to distinguish between the length of two lines is assessed. Your results are shown at the end of the experiment.
